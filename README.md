# FiSa : Fire Safety Ontology

The Fire Safety Ontology (FiSa) enables the classification of buildings and its components based on fire safety
 considerations. FiSa establish a fire safety perspective for buildings utilizing a combination of building codes, technical
  regulations, guidelines, and semi-structured interviews with fire safety planners. Subsequently, fire safety domain insights 
  from experts were aligned to knowledge about building design from other domains, such as architecture. Through this 
  collaborative effort and the instantiation of building data within the ontology, structural fire safety requirements from 
  regulations were automatically inferred by reasoning with common inference engines, simulating an automatic compliance 
  checking.
